Read and Write ('r+’): This method opens the file for both reading and writing. 
                       The start of the file is where the handle is located. 
                       If the file does not exist, an I/O error gets raised.
                       
eg: with open('file.txt', 'r+') as filee:
    filee.read()               
    filee.write("new line \n")                       
             
             
             
Write and Read ('w+’): This mode opens the file for both reading and writing.
                       The start of the file is where the handle is located.
                       The text is overwritten and deleted from an existing file. 
                       
eg: with open('file.txt', 'w+') as filee:   
    filee.write("testing 1\n")
    filee.write("testing 2\n")
    filee.write("testing 3\n")             
    filee.seek(0)                       
    reading=filee.read()                
    print(reading)               
                       
                       
                       
Append and Read (‘a+’): Using this method, you can read and write in the file. 
                        If the file doesn't already exist, one gets created. 
                        The handle is set at the end of the file. 
                        The newly written text will be added at the end, following the previously written data.
                        
eg: with open('file.txt', 'a+') as filee:
    filee.seek(0)                       
    lines = filee.readlines()           
    filee.write("\n" + str(len(lines)))
    filee.write("\nDone!")
